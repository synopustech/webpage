## 🔧 Architecture

This project uses a **modular CSS architecture** with shared common styles and page-specific overrides:

### CSS Architecture
- **`main.css`**: Shared foundation containing CSS variables, base styles, header/footer, buttons, cards, animations, and responsive breakpoints
- **Page-specific CSS**: Each page has its own CSS file with unique styles and overrides
- **Cohesive Design**: Common elements maintained in one place for easy updates
- **Maintainable**: Centralized shared styles reduce code duplication

### Benefits
- ✅ **Maintainable**: Update shared components once, apply everywhere
- ✅ **Cohesive**: Consistent design system across all pages
- ✅ **Organized**: Clear separation between shared and page-specific styles
- ✅ **Efficient**: Reduced code duplication and smaller file sizes
- ✅ **Scalable**: Easy to add new pages with consistent styling
- ✅ **Fast Loading**: Optimized CSS loading with shared caching

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages (Recommended)
1. **Repository Setup:**
   - Push files to a GitHub repository
   - Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
   - The `CNAME` file is already configured for custom domains

2. **Custom Domain:**
   - Update `CNAME` file with your domain name
   - Configure DNS settings with your domain provider
   - GitHub Pages will automatically handle SSL certificates

### Alternative Hosting
- **Netlify:** Upload the entire folder including CSS/JS files for instant deployment
- **Vercel:** Connect GitHub repository for automatic deployments with full file structure
- **Traditional Hosting:** Upload all files via FTP to any web server maintaining folder structure
3. **Domain:**
   - Point your custom domain (e.g., `synopustech.com`) to your host

## Best Practices
- Use descriptive alt text for all images
- Test accessibility with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- Keep all dependencies and contact endpoints up to date
